# ReactJS-Studies
My personal notes on a ReactJS course I took.

## Things to study more
* Webpack
* Loaders
* Vite
* Bundling
* Export and Import inside the browser (Client-Side).
* Best ways of creating components (Class vs Functional components, Stateless vs. Stateful components).
* What are web-vitals and why they are important?
