# 001 - Intro

## What is React?
* React is a JavaScript library for building web and native user interfaces.

## Creating React Projects: Browser-Based Development vs. Local Development
### Browser-Based Development
* You create remote React.js projects via CodeSandbox or other similar options.
* No need to install software. Moreover, no files will be stored in your local file system.
* Usually, you will use a pre-configured editor inside of your browser. Thus, you face some kind of limitations.

### Local Development
* You create React.js projects locally in your own machine.
* This requires the installation of tools and also the creation of files inside your machine.
* However, you can use any editor of your choice along with any settings and extensions that you might like to use. Therefore, you have more freedom over how you develop your projects.
